# web site for development

start node with index.js and open local hosted website to update settings

http://localhost:3000/serve/update?color=%23%23FF0000&hdmode=false&devicename=clock_a3fse&hue=255&ssid=&password=uuuuuuuuuuuu&apmode=false&esistimmeran=false&speechmode=false&ssidlist=WLAN-57F873

run "build.js" to build the website into the arduino ino-file

attention! Arduino IDE need to be closed at that time (as the source files are modified)
